# Pure Functions

Pure functions do not alter state.
They always give the same output for a given input.
This makes them unit-testable and 'prove-able'.

Of course, applications will alter state via outputs and dependencies -
such as writing to database, altering the UI, communicating on the network...

Try this simple assignment to extract 'pure functions'.
Reduce complexity and semantic distance.
