# Assignments

## Suggested weekly flow

Thu - session - clone + read assignment & code

---

Fri to Tue --> (multiple commits permitted)

Tue --> commit 'at least / latest' by EoD

---

Tue --> Latest commit will be picked for review

Wed --> rework or respond

---

Thu - session / recap + next

## Try it

[Fail the false positive](fail.md)

[Modular well-named](small.md) and [recap](small-recap.md)

[C++ entrance](https://classroom.github.com/a/B099OgVp) and [recap](spring-recap.md)

Once you accept:

1. You will get a repository of your own.
1. Observe the failure of a workflow in the `Actions` tab.
1. Clone the repository and code. Do not create any branch. To start, see README.md in your repository.
1. Commit and push to GitHub. This will trigger another run in the `Actions` tab.
1. Ensure that the code compiles and the tests are passing. This will give you a successful run. Check for the green-tick in the `Actions` tab.

...and you're done :)
