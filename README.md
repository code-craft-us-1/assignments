# Assignments

The first assignment is simple - you need to perform basic statistics on a bunch of readings from a sensor.

The intention of this exercise is to check your participation. You would need some exploration to get used to GitHub, Actions and workflows.

Accept the assignment and look for `README.md` in your repository for further information.

Once you accept:

1. You will get a repository of your own. 
1. Observe in the `Actions` tab, that the build is failing.
1. Clone the repository and code. Do not create any branch. To start, see README.md in your repository.
1. Commit and push to GitHub. This will trigger another run in the `Actions` tab.
1. Ensure that the code compiles and the tests are passing. This will give you a successful run. Check for the green-tick in the `Actions` tab.

...and you're done :)
